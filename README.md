# CHEMBAL

I personally hate trying to balance equations, especially when the coefficients are really large. So, I made a program todo it for me. It is still somewhat primitive, but is able to balance just about everything you throw at it (except for anything that requires more than 26 elements). Unfortunately, since there is no way for most people to use lowercase letters, instead of using proper element symbols, you just use individual letters of the alphabet in increasing order for each element (Ex. O2 + C = CO2 becomes A2 + B = BA2). There will eventually be improvements on this in the future, but for now this should be good. To use it, replace the element symbols with a corresponding letter and replace the arrow denoting change with an equals sign.
